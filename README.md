# One Piece Persistent Browser-Based Game (PBBG)

Welcome to the **One Piece Persistent Browser-Based Game**! This project is inspired by the adventures of the *One Piece* world and is designed as a practice environment for me to enhance my skills in building a robust web application using **ASP.NET Core** with a **clean architecture**, while following **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** principles.

This project is still in development, and the main goal is to create a browser-based game where players can:
- Create and customize characters with races, classes, and careers
- Start on the initial island, complete quests, and level up
- Earn and drop items as they progress through different islands from the One Piece universe

## üîç Purpose of the Project

The primary aim of this project is **learning** and **demonstrating my abilities** as a fullstack developer while working on a game inspired by one of my favorite series, *One Piece*. The project also provides a way to practice:
- **Clean architecture** for separation of concerns
- **Dependency injection** to manage object creation and dependencies
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** to ensure reliable and testable code
- **Keycloak integration** for user management and role-based access control

Ultimately, this project serves as a **showcase** of my software development skills to attract the attention of recruiters and potential employers.

## üéÆ Game Concept

In this game, players:
- Create a character with customizable stats, race, class, and career
- Progress through levels by earning experience points from completing quests
- Collect items that are tiered based on rarity, from common to extremely rare
- Advance to new islands after completing objectives on previous islands, starting from the initial island inspired by *One Piece*
